## Description ##

* Must have Bootstrap 3 with Glyphicons.
* Click on a gallery image and swipe through the pop-up.
* Images re-size for mobile devices.
* Option to create pop-ups of all post and page images.
* Light: Only sends 3 small files to the browser. Does nothing if there's no gallery.
* Works with themes "DevDmBootstrap3," "evolve," and "Unite." 
* Doesn't work with "Customizr," "Inkzine," and "Radiant."
* Doesn't change the gallery on your page. Only creates a pop-up when you click. 
* Don't download if you need to be sure this works. This plugin is fast beacuse it uses your Glyphicons. You'll see if it works when you activate it and click on a gallery image, though.
